**Introduction**

The increasing complexity of healthcare systems, especially in
addressing aging-related challenges, necessitates innovative approaches
for developing sustainable and effective policies. **In silico
models**---computational simulations of real-world phenomena---offer an
unparalleled opportunity to understand, predict, and optimize healthcare
processes. However, the successful deployment of such models requires an
in-depth understanding of **societal complexity**, encompassing
stakeholder dynamics, institutional constraints, and incentive
structures.

This research aims to bridge the gap between advanced computational
modeling and its real-world application by leveraging **participatory
modeling** approaches. These approaches bring together diverse
stakeholders to collaboratively develop models that reflect societal and
systemic nuances, ensuring both accuracy and usability.

**Research Objectives**

1.  **Develop a Participatory Modeling Framework**\
    Create a research protocol that captures the agency complexities,
    structural hindrances, and incentive dynamics in healthcare systems,
    with a focus on adopting in silico models at the hospital level.

2.  **Model the Societal Complexity of In Silico Model Deployment**\
    Design a **System Dynamics Model (SDM)** to simulate interactions
    between stakeholders, such as clinicians, hospital administrators,
    and policymakers. The model will explore:

    -   Barriers to model adoption.

    -   Strategies for incentivizing uptake.

    -   Policy implications for healthcare delivery optimization.

3.  **Validate Participatory Methods and Policies**\
    Develop actionable policies through participatory workshops and
    validate the outcomes with real-world stakeholders and data.

4.  **Impact Evaluation**\
    Measure the effectiveness of participatory modeling in driving the
    adoption and success of in silico models within healthcare
    organizations.

**Research Methodology\
**

1.  **Literature Review**\
    Conduct a systematic review of participatory modeling and in silico
    applications in healthcare to identify best practices and gaps in
    current approaches.

2.  **Stakeholder Engagement**

    -   Collaborate with clinicians, administrators, and patients to
        co-develop models.

    -   Utilize workshops, interviews, and surveys to gather qualitative
        data.

3.  **Model Development**

    -   Use **System Dynamics Modeling (SDM)** to represent societal and
        organizational complexities.

    -   Integrate Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to capture uncertainties
        in stakeholder behavior and decision-making.

4.  **Validation and Refinement**

    -   Perform validation against real-world case studies at Karolinska
        University Hospital.

    -   Iterate the model based on stakeholder feedback and data
        analysis.

5.  **Policy Recommendations**

    -   Propose evidence-based policies for facilitating in silico model
        adoption.

    -   Evaluate recommendations during the planned secondment at VU
        Amsterdam.

**Year Planning**

**Year 1: Foundations and Exploration**

-   Conduct a comprehensive literature review on participatory modeling
    and in silico models.

-   Engage with initial stakeholders to map societal and organizational
    complexities.

-   Develop a preliminary framework for participatory modeling.

-   Begin technical modeling work, focusing on System Dynamics Modeling
    (SDM) as a foundational approach.

**Year 2: Model Development and Stakeholder Engagement**

-   Finalize the initial System Dynamics Model based on stakeholder
    feedback.

-   Incorporate Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to address behavioral
    uncertainties.

-   Conduct participatory workshops with stakeholders to refine and
    validate the models.

-   Planned secondment to VU Amsterdam (August, 6 months): Focus on
    institutional dynamics in healthcare organizations and refine
    participatory methods.

**Year 3: Validation and Policy Development**

-   Apply models to case studies, particularly at Karolinska University
    Hospital (April, 4 months).

-   Test and validate policy recommendations with real-world
    stakeholders.

-   Refine models and outputs based on validation results.

**Year 4: Dissemination and Finalization**

-   Publish findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at
    international conferences.

-   Finalize a robust participatory modeling protocol and validated
    policies for in silico model adoption.

-   Complete and defend the doctoral thesis.

**Expected Outcomes**

-   A robust participatory modeling framework tailored to healthcare
    contexts.

-   Insights into stakeholder dynamics and barriers to in silico model
    adoption.

-   Actionable policies for hospital-level deployment of in silico
    models.

-   Contributions to the broader academic discourse on participatory
    modeling and healthcare optimization.

**Significance**

This research aligns with the objectives of the **InSilicoHealth
doctoral network** by addressing challenges in deploying in silico
models for healthy aging. By incorporating societal complexity through
participatory methods, the project seeks to ensure that these models are
not only technically sound but also socially viable and impactful. This
work has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare organizations
adopt computational tools to enhance patient outcomes and operational
efficiency.\
