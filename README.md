## Introduction

The growing complexity of healthcare systems, particularly in addressing aging-related challenges, necessitates innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to develop sustainable and effective policies. *In silico* models—computational simulations of real-world phenomena—offer significant potential to optimize healthcare processes by helping us understand and predict system dynamics. However, deploying these models effectively requires a nuanced understanding of societal complexity, including stakeholder dynamics, institutional barriers, and incentive structures.

This research seeks to bridge the gap between advanced computational modeling and real-world healthcare applications by leveraging **participatory modeling**. This collaborative approach engages diverse stakeholders to co-develop models that reflect societal and systemic nuances, ensuring both accuracy and usability.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Develop a Participatory Modeling Framework**  
   Establish a research protocol to capture complexities of agency, structural hindrances, and incentive dynamics, focusing on hospital-level adoption of *in silico* models.

2. **Model Societal Complexity in Model Deployment**  
   Use System Dynamics Modeling (SDM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to simulate stakeholder interactions, exploring:
   - Barriers to adoption
   - Strategies for incentivizing uptake
   - Policy implications for healthcare delivery optimization

3. **Validate Participatory Methods and Policies**  
   Conduct participatory workshops to develop actionable policies and validate outcomes using real-world stakeholder feedback and data.

4. **Evaluate Impact**  
   Measure the effectiveness of participatory modeling in fostering *in silico* model adoption and its effect on healthcare optimization.

#### Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

- Account for behavioral uncertainties and transition probabilities in stakeholder decision-making.

#### Integration of Qualitative Insights

- Map qualitative findings (e.g., resistance themes, collaboration patterns) into model parameters to ensure real-world accuracy.

---

### 4. Validation and Refinement

- **Participatory Feedback**: Present preliminary models to stakeholders and incorporate their feedback.
- **Case Study Application**: Test models at Karolinska University Hospital.
- **Triangulated Analysis**: Compare model outputs with qualitative and survey data to validate findings.

---

### 5. Policy Recommendations

- Develop evidence-based policies informed by model simulations and stakeholder insights.
- Pilot these recommendations during a planned secondment at VU Amsterdam and refine based on further feedback.

## Expected Findings

1. **Framework Development**  
   - A validated participatory modeling framework for healthcare systems.
   - Practical guidelines for integrating stakeholder perspectives into computational models.

2. **Insights into Societal Complexity**  
   - Quantitative identification of key barriers (e.g., adoption rates, resource constraints).
   - Qualitative understanding of stakeholder dynamics and institutional challenges.

3. **Policy Effectiveness**  
   - Evidence-based strategies to incentivize model uptake.
   - Improved hospital-level outcomes through optimized resource allocation.

4. **Validation of Participatory Modeling**  
   - Enhanced stakeholder alignment and ownership of *in silico* models.
   - Broader acceptance and implementation of proposed policies.
