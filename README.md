**Summary**

We're excited to share our work on **participatory modeling for societal complexity in healthcare**. This project leverages participatory modeling techniques to address the complexities of healthcare systems. The code is designed for scalability and flexibility, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to evolving needs.

This project combines **quantitative** and **qualitative** analysis to simulate and evaluate stakeholder engagement in healthcare systems. It models engagement levels for various activities across key stakeholder groups—patients, doctors, nurses, and administrators—over time, and provides insights using both data-driven metrics and expert interpretation.

***Key features of the project include:***

***Quantitative Analysis:***

- **Engagement Simulation**: The project simulates monthly fluctuations in engagement levels for each stakeholder and activity, generating a time series of engagement data.
- **Statistical Metrics**: The mean engagement levels for each stakeholder and activity are calculated to quantify overall performance, as well as the consistency of engagement over time.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations, including line plots of engagement trends and stakeholder comparisons, provide clear insights into engagement patterns.

***Qualitative Analysis:***

- **Stakeholder Insights**: The project interprets quantitative data by identifying trends in engagement for each stakeholder, offering qualitative insights into whether certain stakeholders show positive or negative engagement.
- **Key Activity Identification**: It highlights activities with lower-than-average engagement, suggesting areas that may require improvement or additional focus.
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Based on engagement data, it provides qualitative recommendations for areas needing attention, such as fluctuating engagement or low uptake of specific activities.

By merging both **quantitative** metrics (e.g., average engagement levels, uptake rates) with **qualitative** insights (e.g., identifying trends, interpreting fluctuations), the project provides a holistic approach to understanding stakeholder engagement in healthcare. It helps in decision-making by visualizing patterns and suggesting actionable improvements based on both hard data and expert interpretation.

This project follows a **cutting-edge, rolling release model**, with regular updates that continuously enhance the functionality and performance of the applications. It is designed to be scalable and flexible, enabling easy adaptation to evolving needs in healthcare systems.



## Introduction

The growing complexity of healthcare systems, particularly in addressing aging-related challenges, necessitates innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to develop sustainable and effective policies. *In silico* models—computational simulations of real-world phenomena—offer significant potential to optimize healthcare processes by helping us understand and predict system dynamics. However, deploying these models effectively requires a nuanced understanding of societal complexity, including stakeholder dynamics, institutional barriers, and incentive structures.

This research seeks to bridge the gap between advanced computational modeling and real-world healthcare applications by leveraging **participatory modeling**. This collaborative approach engages diverse stakeholders to co-develop models that reflect societal and systemic nuances, ensuring both accuracy and usability.

## Research Objectives

1. **Develop a Participatory Modeling Framework**  
   Establish a research protocol to capture complexities of agency, structural hindrances, and incentive dynamics, focusing on hospital-level adoption of *in silico* models.

2. **Model Societal Complexity in Model Deployment**  
   Use System Dynamics Modeling (SDM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to simulate stakeholder interactions, exploring:
   - Barriers to adoption
   - Strategies for incentivizing uptake
   - Policy implications for healthcare delivery optimization

3. **Validate Participatory Methods and Policies**  
   Conduct participatory workshops to develop actionable policies and validate outcomes using real-world stakeholder feedback and data.

4. **Evaluate Impact**  
   Measure the effectiveness of participatory modeling in fostering *in silico* model adoption and its effect on healthcare optimization.
