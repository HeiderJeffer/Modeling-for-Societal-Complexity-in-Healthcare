### Participatory Modeling for Societal Complexity in Healthcare

*by Heider Jeffer*

### Hello and welcome!
We're excited to share our work on participatory modeling for societal complexity in healthcare.

This project leverages participatory modeling techniques to address the complexities of healthcare systems. The code is designed for scalability and flexibility, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to evolving needs.

It follows a cutting-edge, rolling release model, with regular updates that continuously enhance the functionality and performance of the applications.

We encourage you to explore, experiment, and share your thoughts with us!
