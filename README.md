**Introduction**

The increasing complexity of healthcare systems, particularly in
addressing aging-related challenges, calls for innovative,
multi-disciplinary approaches to develop sustainable and effective
policies. Computational simulations of real-world phenomena, known as
*in silico* models, provide unparalleled opportunities to optimize
healthcare processes by understanding and predicting system dynamics.
However, deploying these models requires a nuanced understanding of
societal complexity, including stakeholder dynamics, institutional
barriers, and incentive structures.

This research aims to bridge the gap between advanced computational
modeling and real-world healthcare applications by leveraging
**participatory modeling**. This collaborative approach engages diverse
stakeholders to co-develop models that reflect societal and systemic
nuances, ensuring both accuracy and usability.

**Research Objectives**

1.  **Develop a Participatory Modeling Framework**\
    Establish a research protocol to capture agency complexities,
    structural hindrances, and incentive dynamics, focusing on
    hospital-level adoption of *in silico* models.

2.  **Model Societal Complexity in Model Deployment**\
    Use System Dynamics Modeling (SDM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
    to simulate interactions between stakeholders, such as clinicians,
    administrators, and policymakers, to explore:

    -   Barriers to adoption,

    -   Strategies for incentivizing uptake,

    -   Policy implications for healthcare delivery optimization.

3.  **Validate Participatory Methods and Policies**\
    Develop actionable policies through participatory workshops and
    validate outcomes using real-world stakeholder feedback and data.

4.  **Evaluate Impact**\
    Measure the effectiveness of participatory modeling in fostering *in
    silico* model adoption and its effect on healthcare optimization.

**Research Approach**

**Mixed Methods Framework**

This research integrates qualitative and quantitative methodologies to
provide a comprehensive understanding of societal complexities in
