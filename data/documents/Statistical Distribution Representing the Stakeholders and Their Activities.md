# Statistical Distribution Representing the Stakeholders and Their Activities
*By Heider Jeffer*

To design a statistical distribution representing the stakeholders and their activities, we can approach it in the following structured steps:

## Goal:

To visualize the distribution of engagement levels for each stakeholder and their activities over a simulated period. This distribution will highlight patterns, variability, and central tendencies.

## Design Plan:

1. Data Representation:

- Use the engagement simulation data for stakeholders and activities
```
(df_activity_engagement).
```

- Group engagement levels by stakeholder and activity.

2. Distribution Type:

- Use box plots to showcase engagement level distributions across months for each stakeholder and activity.
- Alternatively, use kernel density plots (KDE) or histograms for a smoothed view of engagement level distributions.

3. Implementation:

- Each stakeholder will have a separate visualization grouping their activities.
- We'll use subplots to show side-by-side comparisons of engagement distributions for activities.


4. Visualization:

- Label axes appropriately (Activity, Engagement Level).
- Add titles for clarity, e.g., "Engagement Level Distribution for Stakeholders and Activities."
- Ensure the legend identifies stakeholders or activities.

## Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you can create the distribution visualization:

```Python
# Statistical Distribution Visualization for Stakeholders and Activities
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))

# Create a subplot for each stakeholder
stakeholders_list = df_activity_engagement['Stakeholder'].unique()
for i, stakeholder in enumerate(stakeholders_list, 1):
    plt.subplot(2, 2, i)
    stakeholder_df = df_activity_engagement[df_activity_engagement['Stakeholder'] == stakeholder]
    
    # Create a boxplot for each activity
    sns.boxplot(data=stakeholder_df, x='Activity', y='Engagement', palette="viridis")
    
    # Enhance plot appearance
    plt.title(f"Engagement Level Distribution - {stakeholder}")
    plt.xlabel("Activity")
    plt.ylabel("Engagement Level")
    plt.ylim(0, 1)
    plt.xticks(rotation=30, ha='right')

# Adjust layout
plt.tight_layout()
plt.suptitle("Engagement Level Distribution for Stakeholders and Their Activities", fontsize=16, y=1.02)
plt.show()
```

## Explanation of the Visualization:


1. Boxplot:

- The box shows the interquartile range (IQR) of engagement levels for each activity (middle 50% of data).
- The line inside the box indicates the median engagement level.
- Whiskers and potential outliers show variability.

2. Customization:

- Stakeholders are grouped into separate subplots for clarity.
- Activities are plotted on the x-axis, engagement levels on the y-axis.

## Additional Insights (Optional):
- Overlay KDE or Histogram: For an individual stakeholder's activities, plot engagement levels as a density curve or histogram for better insight into engagement trends.
- Heatmap: Create a heatmap showing average engagement levels for stakeholders and activities.
