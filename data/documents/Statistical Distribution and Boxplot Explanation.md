### Statistical Distribution and Boxplot Explanation
* By Heider Jeffer

The **boxplot** used in the code visualizes the statistical distribution of engagement levels for each activity of a given stakeholder. In this case, the boxplot will help to understand the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers of the engagement levels.

A **boxplot** (also known as a **box-and-whisker plot**) is used to display the distribution of a dataset. It shows the following:

1. **Median (Q2)**: The middle value of the dataset (50th percentile).
2. **First Quartile (Q1)**: The 25th percentile, or the median of the lower half of the data.
3. **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The 75th percentile, or the median of the upper half of the data.
4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It represents the middle 50% of the data.
5. **Whiskers**: These lines extend from the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) to show the range of data. The whiskers typically extend to 1.5 * IQR from Q1 and Q3, beyond which points are considered as outliers.
6. **Outliers**: Data points that fall outside the whiskers are considered outliers and are typically marked as dots.

### Formulae for Boxplot Construction:

Given a dataset of engagement levels for a particular activity, here are the key steps/formulae involved in calculating the statistics used in a boxplot:

1. **Median (Q2)**: 
   \[
   \text{Median} = \text{middle value of sorted data}
   \]
   If the number of data points is odd, it's the middle number. If even, itâ€™s the average of the two middle values.

2. **First Quartile (Q1)**: 
   \[
   Q1 = \text{median of the lower half of the dataset}
   \]

3. **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 
   \[
   Q3 = \text{median of the upper half of the dataset}
   \]

4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
   \[
   \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
   \]

5. **Whiskers**: The whiskers extend to:
   \[
   \text{Lower whisker} = \max(\text{Minimum value}, Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Upper whisker} = \min(\text{Maximum value}, Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR})
   \]
   Any data points outside these whiskers are considered outliers.

### Numerical Example

Let's walk through a simple numerical example based on the `df_activity_engagement` data, using one activity for a single stakeholder (say **Patients** and their activity **Participation in Care**).

Assume we have the following engagement levels for **Patients** in the activity **Participation in Care** over 12 months:

```
[0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.6, 0.8, 0.65, 0.7, 0.55]
```

#### Step 1: Sort the Data
Sort the data in ascending order:

```
[0.55, 0.55, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.65, 0.65, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8]
```

#### Step 2: Calculate the Median (Q2)
- There are 12 values, so the median is the average of the 6th and 7th values:
  \[
  \text{Median} = \frac{0.65 + 0.65}{2} = 0.65
  \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the First Quartile (Q1)
- The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data (first 6 values):
  \[
  \text{Lower half: } [0.55, 0.55, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.65]
  \]
  The median of this half is the average of the 3rd and 4th values:
  \[
  Q1 = \frac{0.6 + 0.6}{2} = 0.6
  \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Third Quartile (Q3)
- The third quartile is the median of the upper half of the data (last 6 values):
  \[
  \text{Upper half: } [0.65, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8]
  \]
  The median of this half is the average of the 3rd and 4th values:
  \[
  Q3 = \frac{0.7 + 0.7}{2} = 0.7
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR)
\[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 = 0.7 - 0.6 = 0.1
\]

#### Step 6: Calculate the Whiskers
- The lower whisker extends to:
  \[
  \text{Lower whisker} = \max(\text{Minimum value}, Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = \max(0.55, 0.6 - 1.5 \times 0.1) = \max(0.55, 0.45) = 0.55
  \]
- The upper whisker extends to:
  \[
  \text{Upper whisker} = \min(\text{Maximum value}, Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = \min(0.8, 0.7 + 1.5 \times 0.1) = \min(0.8, 0.85) = 0.8
  \]

#### Step 7: Identify Outliers
- The outliers are any data points that fall outside the whiskers (below 0.55 or above 0.8). In this case, there are **no outliers**, as all data points fall within the whiskers.

### Final Distribution
- **Median (Q2)**: 0.65
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: 0.6
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 0.7
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: 0.1
- **Lower Whisker**: 0.55
- **Upper Whisker**: 0.8
- **Outliers**: None

### Boxplot Interpretation
For the activity **Participation in Care**:
- The **box** will span from **0.6** (Q1) to **0.7** (Q3), with the **median line** at **0.65**.
- The **whiskers** will extend from **0.55** (lower) to **0.8** (upper).
- All the data points will fall within the whiskers, so there will be **no outliers**.

### Visualization in the Code
- The **boxplot** will show a box from **0.6** to **0.7**, a line at **0.65** (median), and whiskers extending from **0.55** to **0.8**.
- If we had more data with more variation, the whiskers and box might expand or outliers could be detected, showing how the engagement levels fluctuate for the activity.

### Conclusion:
This is how the boxplot visualizes the distribution of engagement levels for an activity. By repeating this process for all activities and stakeholders, we can get a comprehensive view of how engagement varies across the stakeholders and their activities, identifying trends, stability, and outliers.
